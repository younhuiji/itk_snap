ITK-SNAP README
-----------------

### Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in ITK-SNAP! By using this program you are joining
an ever growing community of users from research labs around the world.
ITK-SNAP is an open-source software application made possible by the
committment of dedicated developers, who often make contributions on a
volunteer basis. Original development of ITK-SNAP was supported by the U.S.
National Library of Medicine through PO 467-MZ-202446-1. Subsequent
development of ITK-SNAP version 2.0 has been supported by the U.S. National
Institute of Biomedical Imaging and BioEngineering and the NIH Blueprint for
Neuroscience through grant 1 R03 EB008200-01. Development of ITK-SNAP versions
3.0 - 3.6 has been supported by the NIH grant 1R01 EB014346. 

ITK-SNAP is the result of over 20 years of work by many researchers, software
engineers and students. Please visit the [Credits page](http:/itksnap.org/credits.php) 
to learn about the team that made ITK-SNAP possible!
